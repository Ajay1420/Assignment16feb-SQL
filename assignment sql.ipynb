    "Ans(1)- A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a computer system. Databases are used to manage large amounts of data and make it easy to store, retrieve, and manipulate data. There are two main types of databases: SQL and NoSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases, also known as relational databases, are based on the relational model of data. In a SQL database, data is stored in tables, and the relationships between the tables are defined by keys. SQL databases use SQL (Structured Query Language) to interact with the data. SQL is a declarative language that allows users to specify what they want to retrieve from the database, rather than how to retrieve it. SQL databases are typically used for transactional data, such as financial records or inventory management.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are not based on the relational model of data. Instead, they use a variety of data models, such as document, key-value, or graph. NoSQL databases are designed to be highly scalable and flexible, making them well-suited for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. NoSQL databases are often used for web applications, social media platforms, and other data-intensive applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main differences between SQL and NoSQL databases are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Data model: SQL databases use a relational data model, while NoSQL databases use a variety of non-relational data models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Query language: SQL databases use SQL to interact with data, while NoSQL databases use a variety of query languages, such as MongoDB's query        language or Cassandra's CQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Scalability: NoSQL databases are generally designed to be more scalable than SQL databases, especially when it comes to handling large volumes      of unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Flexibility: NoSQL databases are often more flexible than SQL databases, making it easier to adapt to changing data requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Consistency: SQL databases are generally more consistent than NoSQL databases, as they enforce strict data validation and consistency rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both SQL and NoSQL databases have their strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between them depends on the specific needs of the application.\n"

    "Ans(5)-Primary Key and Foreign Key are two important concepts in database design that are used to establish relationships between tables.\n",

    "A Primary Key is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in the table. It serves as the primary means of identifying records in a table and is used to enforce data integrity by ensuring that each record in the table is unique. A primary key cannot contain null values and must be unique and immutable.\n",
    "\n",

    "A Foreign Key is a column or set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a relationship between the two tables and helps to enforce data integrity by ensuring that only valid data is entered into the table. A foreign key can have null values, indicating that there is no corresponding value in the referenced table.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a \"courses\" table, the \"student_id\" column could be used as a foreign key to link each course to the student who is enrolled in it. The \"student_id\" column would refer to the \"id\" column in the \"students\" table.\n",
